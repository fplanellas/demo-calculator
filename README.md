# Getting Started with Create React App

#Usage
##Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
##npm install

##Features
Addition: Click the + button to add the two input numbers.
Subtraction: Click the - button to subtract the second number from the first number.
Multiplication: Click the * button to multiply the two input numbers.
Division: Click the / button to divide the first number by the second number.

##How it Works
The component uses the useState hook from React to manage the input values (num1 and num2), the result (result), and the error message (error).
When a button is clicked, the calculate function is called with the corresponding operation as an argument.
Inside the calculate function, the input values are parsed as floating-point numbers. If any of the input values is not a valid number, an error message is set.
The result is calculated based on the selected operation using a switch statement. If division by zero is attempted, an error message is displayed.
The error message and result are rendered conditionally based on their values.

##Customization
You can customize the appearance of the calculator by modifying the CSS styles defined in the App.css file. Feel free to adapt it to fit your project's design.

##Dependencies
This component relies on the following dependencies:

react (version 18 or higher)
@mui/material (version 5.0 or higher)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
